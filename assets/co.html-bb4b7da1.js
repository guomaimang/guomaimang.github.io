This is because CSRF attacks rely on the attacker being able to predict or manipulate the session token. By regenerating the session token after a successful login, you ensure that any session token the attacker might have obtained or predicted is invalidated, thus mitigating the risk of CSRF attacks.</p>',7),d={href:"http://a.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p={href:"http://b.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},u={href:"http://a.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g={href:"http://b.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m={href:"http://a.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f={href:"http://subdomain.a.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b={href:"http://b.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k=i("<p><strong>Can a web server receive cookies with the same name but different values?</strong></p><p>No, a web server cannot receive cookies with the same name but different values for the same path and domain. If multiple cookies with the same name are set for the same path and domain, the browser will typically send only one cookie, and which one gets sent can be unpredictable. This can lead to inconsistencies and potential security issues. However, cookies with the same name can exist if they are set for different paths or subdomains.</p><p><strong>Whitelist validation is better than blacklist validation on user input.</strong></p><p>Yes, whitelist validation (also known as allowlist validation) is generally considered better than blacklist validation (blocklist validation) when it comes to user input. Whitelist validation involves defining a strict set of acceptable inputs and rejecting everything else, which is more secure because it minimizes the risk of unexpected or malicious input slipping through. Blacklist validation, on the other hand, involves defining a set of known bad inputs to reject, which can be incomplete and susceptible to new, unknown attack vectors.</p><p><strong>Give two benefits of using cloud services over on-premise servers.</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Cloud services offer dynamic scalability, allowing organizations to quickly and easily scale their resources up or down based on demand without having to invest in physical hardware.</li><li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: Cloud services often operate on a pay-as-you-go model, which can reduce the costs associated with maintaining and upgrading on-premise infrastructure.
