# DS in Practice

## Stages in Data Science Lifecycle

1. Data acquisition
2. Data cleaning and data warehousing
3. Data modeling and data summarization
4. Data analysis and data regression
5. Data visualization

## Main Types of Data Analytics

- **Predictive analytics**: To make predictions about future trends or events and answers the question i.e. “What might happen in the future?”
- **Descriptive analytics**: To pull trends from raw data and succinctly describe what happened or is currently happening, i.e. “What happened?”
- **Prescriptive analytics**: To take into account all possible factors in a scenario and suggest actionable takeaways i.e. “What should we do next?”
- (Optional) **Diagnostic analytics**: To compare coexisting trends or movement, uncovering correlations between variables, and determining causal relationships where possible, i.e. “Why did this happen?”

## Different Levels of Risks

### Unacceptable Risks: (Prohibited)

- Voice-activated toys that encourage dangerous behaviour in children
- Biometric identification
- Social scoring
- Deceptive techniques
- Facial recognition databases 

Exception: law enforcement purposes

### High Risks: (Conformity Assessment)

Conformity Assessment「符合性评估」

-  AI systems in cars, medical devices
- AI systems used in education, vocational training, employment
- AI system for record-keeping

### Limited Risks: (Transparency)

- ChatGPT
- Deep Fakes
- Chat bots

### Minimal Risks: (Code of Conducts)

- AI enabled video games
- Spam filters

## Python Identifiers

**Identifiers** are **names** given by programmers to variables, functions, etc. in a program

An identifier must conform to the following rules:

- Contains only
  - Alphabets (A – Z, a – z)
  - Digits (0 – 9)
  - Underscore characters (_)
- First character cannot be a digit
- Case sensitive
- Cannot be one of the reserved words
