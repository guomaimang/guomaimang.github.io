- **Descriptive analytics**: To pull trends from raw data and succinctly describe what happened or is currently happening, i.e. “What happened?”
- **Prescriptive analytics**: To take into account all possible factors in a scenario and suggest actionable takeaways i.e. “What should we do next?”
- (Optional) **Diagnostic analytics**: To compare coexisting trends or movement, uncovering correlations between variables, and determining causal relationships where possible, i.e. “Why did this happen?”
